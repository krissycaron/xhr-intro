// console.log("Hello!");

// var x = 5; //you can access this anywhere, throughout this sdocument "x" is ALWAYs 5 

// div.innerHTML = x; 

// var y = 4;

// div.innerHTML +=y; //take the top of the file and goes down and compiles so this is going to show as 54 not 9. 

// // asynchronis code .. you have to wait to get the data from server . 

// var z = some XHR request; // have to wait and come back to and from server ... Javascript does not wait for you ... must tell it when to do things. 
// // this is remedied by call back functions this will know when to stop and wait for data to return  before proceeding. 
// function dostuff {
// div.innterHTML += z
// }
// div.addEventListener("click", doStuff);
// // instead of user driven action, it will be server/action driven.
